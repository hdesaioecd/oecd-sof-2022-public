# Public repository of States of Fragility 2022

This repository contains the full replication code for the construction of the 2022 edition of the OECD's multidimensional fragility framework, featured in States of Fragility 2022 (http://www3.compareyourcountry.org/states-of-fragility/report/0/). This code was produced by David Hammond from the Institute for Economics and Peace. It was subsequently edited by Harsh Desai and Kazuma Yabe (kazuma.yabe@oecd.org) and peer-reviewed for the 2022 edition by David Hammond and Andrew Etchell (also from IEP).

All files are replicable as of September 19, 2022. If you have any trouble running the code, please check your package versions (particularly for the tidyverse, which is known to cause issues) and contact Kazuma Yabe for support. The code was created and tested in both Mac OSX and Windows. 

To output the full results of the fragility framework, please run files "01" to "04" in the SRC folder. Files "05" to "07" will produce some of the results featured on the States of Fragility platform and States of Fragility 2022 report (though some of the code may be in draft form or reflect analysis that was not ultimately used in the report, so please contact Kazuma Yabe if there are any questions - files 01-04 are in final form and reflect the principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering approach used to produce the fragility framework). 

For further details on the methodology, please see: http://www3.compareyourcountry.org/states-of-fragility/about/0/. Further details on IEP's peer review is available upon request.
